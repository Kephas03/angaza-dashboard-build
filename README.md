### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd angaza-foundation-dashboard
\`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
\`\`\`bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
\`\`\`

3. **Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
\`\`\`env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Pachangu Integration
PACHANGU_API_KEY=your_pachangu_api_key
PACHANGU_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_PACHANGU_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key

# Application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

4. **Run the development server**
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
\`\`\`

5. **Open your browser**
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
\`\`\`bash
vercel --prod
\`\`\`

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
Add all environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables.

3. **Set up Firebase Security Rules**
Configure Firestore security rules for production use.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- **Client-side validation** for all form inputs
- **Role-based access control** through navigation restrictions
- **Input sanitization** for search and filter functionality
- **Secure environment variable handling**
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production

### Security Recommendations

#### High Priority
1. **Implement server-side authentication** using Firebase Auth
2. **Add Firestore security rules** to protect data access
3. **Implement proper session management** with secure tokens
4. **Add CSRF protection** for form submissions
5. **Implement rate limiting** for API endpoints

#### Medium Priority
1. **Add input validation** on the server side
2. **Implement audit logging** for sensitive operations
3. **Add two-factor authentication** for admin users
4. **Secure file upload validation** for document management
5. **Implement data encryption** for sensitive information

#### Security Audit Findings
- ⚠️ **Missing Authentication**: Currently no server-side authentication implementation
- ⚠️ **Client-side Only**: All logic runs on the client without server validation
- ⚠️ **No Data Protection**: Firestore security rules need implementation
- ⚠️ **Missing CSRF Protection**: Forms vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
- ⚠️ **No Rate Limiting**: API endpoints need protection against abuse
